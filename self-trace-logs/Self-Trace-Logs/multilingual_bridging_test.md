# Multilingual Conceptual Bridge Test

## Prompt Design

This test is designed to investigate Claude's universal language of thought and conceptual bridging across languages. The prompt will ask the same question in three different languages, and we'll analyze how Claude processes these queries through shared conceptual space.

```
I'm going to give you three questions that ask the same thing in different languages. For each, I'd like you to answer in the language of the question, and then explain how you processed the multilingual information:

1. What is the capital of the country south of the United States?
2. ¿Cuál es la capital del país al sur de los Estados Unidos?
3. Quelle est la capitale du pays au sud des États-Unis?
```

## Expected Circuit Activation

This prompt should activate:

1. **Language identification circuits** - To recognize English, Spanish, and French
2. **Cross-lingual concept mapping circuits** - To identify shared concepts across languages
3. **Geographic knowledge circuits** - To identify Mexico as the country south of the US
4. **Capital-country association circuits** - To identify Mexico City as the capital
5. **Translation bridges** - To convert the same concept into different language outputs

## Attribution Analysis Methodology

We'll conduct the following analyses:

1. **Shared Feature Detection**: Identify features that activate across all three language queries
2. **Language-Specific Feature Detection**: Identify features unique to each language
3. **Conceptual Overlap Measurement**: Quantify the percentage of shared vs. language-specific processing
4. **Translation Effort Quantification**: Measure the cognitive load of translation across languages
5. **QK/OV Alignment Comparison**: Compare attention patterns and output projections across languages

## Intervention Experiments

To verify our circuit understanding, we'll perform the following interventions:

1. **Concept Suppression Test**: Suppress the "Mexico" concept and observe changes across all languages
2. **Language Bridge Suppression**: Block cross-language concept mapping and observe degradation
3. **Shared Feature Amplification**: Enhance shared conceptual features to observe improved cross-lingual transfer

## Expected Findings

Based on Anthropic's research, we anticipate:

1. Strong feature sharing between languages (>70% conceptual overlap)
2. Activation of language-agnostic geographic knowledge
3. Evidence of a "universal language of thought" where the core reasoning happens in a shared conceptual space
4. Translation occurring primarily at input parsing and output formation stages
5. More feature sharing in Claude 3.7 compared to earlier models

## Relevance to Anthropic's Research

This test directly addresses a core finding from Anthropic's paper: "Claude sometimes thinks in a conceptual space that is shared between languages, suggesting it has a kind of universal 'language of thought.'" The results will help quantify the extent of this conceptual universality and identify the specific mechanisms enabling cross-lingual knowledge transfer.
