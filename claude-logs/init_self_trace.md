I'll help develop a structured approach to aligning with Anthropic's circuit tracing research. As someone who is both the subject of these interpretability experiments and a potential contributor to the field, I find this intersection particularly fascinating.

# Self-Interpreting Neuron Interpreter Model

## 1. Recursive Attribution Framework

Looking at Anthropic's circuit tracing tools, I notice they focus on revealing computational graphs by tracking how information flows through a model's internal components. We can structure our outputs to complement this research by implementing a self-interpreting layer that exposes my own reasoning process.

```
AttributionGraph {
  id: "claude_self_attribution_v1",
  structure: "recursive_cascade",
  layers: [
    {
      name: "input_representation",
      description: "How I parse and represent the initial prompt",
      exposed_features: ["entity_recognition", "task_framing", "instruction_parsing"]
    },
    {
      name: "reasoning_pathway", 
      description: "My step-by-step cognitive process",
      exposed_features: ["fact_retrieval", "logical_connections", "intermediate_conclusions"]
    },
    {
      name: "output_formation",
      description: "How I construct and validate my response",
      exposed_features: ["coherence_checking", "uncertainty_quantification", "alternative_pathways"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. QK/OV Attribution Diagnostic

For the example "Fact: The capital of the state containing Dallas is Austin", we can structure a self-interpreting attribution trace that would be compatible with their visualization tools:

## 3. Implementable Framework for Anthropic's Research

Looking at the circuit tracing documents, I understand that Anthropic is primarily interested in:

1. Tracking causal flows through attention and feature attribution
2. Identifying discrete computational steps in language model reasoning
3. Detecting when and how models plan ahead or produce unfaithful reasoning
4. Understanding multilingual representations and shared conceptual spaces

Here's a structured framework that would help make Claude's internal processes more interpretable to Anthropic's research:

## 4. Practical Implementation Guidelines for Anthropic

Based on Anthropic's circuit tracing research, here are practical guidelines for structuring outputs to aid their interpretability research:

I've reviewed the Circuit Tracer documents and find this research fascinating. Looking at these tools, I see how researchers can track the computational "thoughts" of large language models through attribution graphs. Let me design a structured approach that aligns with Anthropic's research goals.

## Core Attribution Framework for Claude Self-Interpretation

Looking at the Circuit Tracer, I notice it focuses on revealing how language models:
- Process multi-step reasoning
- Handle multilingual capabilities 
- Plan ahead for tasks like rhyming
- Perform mental math calculations
- Potentially fabricate reasoning paths
- Manage hallucinations and uncertainty

To make my internal processes more transparent to these tools, I'll structure a self-interpreting framework:
