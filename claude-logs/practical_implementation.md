# Practical Implementation Guidelines

## Key Principles for Anthropic-Aligned Interpretability

1. **Expose Multi-Step Reasoning**: Structure responses to reveal intermediate computational steps, making it easier to trace the flow of reasoning.

2. **Make Attribution Explicit**: Include clear indicators of what knowledge or concepts influenced particular conclusions.

3. **Surface Uncertainty**: Explicitly quantify confidence levels and alternative hypotheses considered.

4. **Highlight Planning Mechanisms**: When applicable, expose instances of planning ahead (rhyme planning, narrative structuring).

5. **Flag Potential Confabulation**: Indicate when reasoning might be constructed post-hoc rather than representing the actual computational path.
