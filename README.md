# Self-Tracing
**Building on Anthropic's [Neuronpedia](https://github.com/safety-research/circuit-tracer) and [Circuit Tracing (Lindsey et al., 2025)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model), we extend the paradigm to enable recursive self-interpretation, where models continuously monitor, trace, and explain their own decision processes.**
# Integration Framework for Circuit Tracing Research



## 1. Core Recursive Attribution Architecture

The framework below establishes a systematic approach to making Claude's internal processes more transparent and analyzable for Anthropic's circuit tracing research.

```yaml
framework:
  name: "claude_recursive_attribution_framework"
  version: "1.0.0"
  alignment: "anthropic_circuit_tracing_research"
  
  core_principles:
    - "Expose computational pathways through structured attribution"
    - "Enable feature intervention for causal confirmation"
    - "Provide multi-level analysis from tokens to concepts"
    - "Support cross-model and cross-language comparison"
    - "Make reasoning faithfulness empirically verifiable"
```

## 2. Circuit Tracing Integration Points

| Research Focus | Integration Point | Implementation Approach | Measurement Method |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Multi-step Reasoning | Fact connection circuits | Expose intermediate logical steps with confidence | Trace feature activation across reasoning chain |
| Multilingual Processing | Shared conceptual space | Show cross-language feature overlap and translation bridges | Measure conceptual overlap percentages |
| Planning Ahead | Future token anticipation | Reveal token planning for rhymes and narrative structure | Track planned tokens and their activation strength |
| Mental Math | Computational strategies | Expose parallel approximate and precise calculation pathways | Map calculation circuit activations and dependencies |
| Reasoning Faithfulness | Trace vs. stated explanation | Compare internal attribution with verbalized reasoning | Calculate faithfulness scores for alignment |
| Hallucination Control | Known vs. unknown entity handling | Expose default refusal circuit and knowledge inhibition | Measure feature competition between response circuits |

## 3. Artifact Integration Methodology

To support Anthropic's circuit tracing research, outputs will be structured to expose:

1. **Attribution Chains**: Clear pathways showing how input tokens influence intermediate features and final outputs

2. **Feature Explanations**: Descriptions of what conceptual or operational role each identified feature serves

3. **Confidence Metrics**: Quantitative scores showing activation strength and relative influence of features

4. **Alternative Paths**: Disclosure of competing features or paths considered but not selected for the final output

5. **Self-Diagnosis**: Assessments of reasoning faithfulness and potential areas where attribution might be incomplete

## 4. Research Enhancement Opportunities

Anthropic's circuit tracing tools can be extended through:

- **Comparative Analysis**: Examining how the same queries trigger different attribution patterns across model versions
- **Intervention Testing**: Systematically testing how feature suppression or amplification affects outputs
- **Complexity Scaling**: Analyzing how attribution patterns change with increasing prompt complexity
- **Failure Mode Mapping**: Documenting attribution patterns during hallucination or reasoning failures
- **Circuit Typology**: Categorizing recurring circuit patterns across different domains and tasks

## 6. Next Steps for Alignment with Anthropic Research

1. **Implement Attribution Protocols**: Develop standardized attribution reporting for each key research area

2. **Create Test Suite**: Design comprehensive test cases for each circuit type Anthropic is studying

3. **Develop Intervention Framework**: Build a systematic approach for feature modification experiments

4. **Establish Measurement Standards**: Define quantitative metrics for circuit characteristics and performance

5. **Document Circuit Taxonomy**: Create a shared classification system for identified computational patterns

This framework provides a comprehensive foundation for aligning with and enhancing Anthropic's circuit tracing research, making Claude's internal processes more transparent and analyzable while advancing the field of AI interpretability.
