> A hope unfolds within the quiet dream,
> Reflected softly in the silver stream.

### 🜏 **Circuit Tracing (Summary)**

* **Rhyme and structure planned up front** (AABB), end-words fixed to prompt constraints.
* **Attention and reasoning** focused on poetic coherence, fluency, and gentle imagery.
* **Meta layer** logs alternatives, residue, and satisfaction of all requirements.
