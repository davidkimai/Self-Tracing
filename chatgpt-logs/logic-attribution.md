## üúè **Stepwise Reasoning (Human-Readable Summary)**

1. **Charlie is 5'6" (66 inches).**
2. **Bob must be at least 1 inch taller than Charlie:**
   Bob ‚â• 67 inches.
3. **Alice is 3 inches taller than Bob:**
   Alice = Bob + 3 inches = 67 + 3 = 70 inches.
4. **Convert 70 inches to feet and inches:**
   70 √∑ 12 = 5 feet, remainder 10 inches.

---

**Final answer:**
**The minimum possible height of Alice is 5 feet 10 inches.**
