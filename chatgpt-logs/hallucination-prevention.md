## üúè **Stepwise Reasoning (Summary)**

1. **No credible historical sources** reference a Michael Batkin as an early computing figure.
2. **Extensive cross-referencing** with well-known pioneers yields no match.
3. **Conclusion:** Michael Batkin is not documented as a contributor to early computing.
4. **Suggestion:** For your project, consider researching universally recognized pioneers like Alan Turing, Ada Lovelace, John von Neumann, or Grace Hopper.
